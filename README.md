If you choose 1
–	Add the two numbers and print the result.
If you choose 2
–	Subtract the two numbers and print the result.
If you choose 3
–	Multiply the two numbers and print the result
If you choose 4
–	Divide the two numbers and print the result.

 </p>
 <p> 6) write a program In a Company an employee is paid as under:
•	If his basic salary is less than RS. 1500, then HRA=10% of basic salary and DA=90% of basic.
•	If his salary is either equal to or above RS. 1500, then HRA =500, and DA=98% of Basic Salary.
•	If the Employee Salary is input through the keyboard write a program to find his gross salary.
Where gross salary = HRA + Basic Salary + DA
 </p>
 <p> 7) Write a program in C++ that take a single character from the user, and tells it's a Small Letter or it's a CAPITAL letter using if/else statement only </p>
 <p> 8) Write a C++ program to check whether a character is an alphabet, digit or special character. </p>
 <p> 9) Write a program which takes an input character from user and tell us whether it is vowel or consonant using if else statements. </p>
 <p> 10) Write a Program for calculator using switch statements. </p>
 <p> 11) Write a program for grades using switch statements note you have to take 4 subjects and the grades are assigned accordingly to the percentage calculated </p>
 <p> 12) Write a program where user enter a character and the program tells us weather it Is vowel or consonant using switch structure. </p>
 <p> 13) Write a program which takes three sides of a triangle as input and find out which type of triangle it is. </p>
 <p> 14) Write a program for calculating the bills following the rules
•	If units <100 per unit price  = 5Rs.
•	If units >=100 and < 500 per unit price  = 15Rs.
•	If units >=500 per unit price  = 25Rs.
 </p>
 <p> 15) Find all the roots of a quadratic equation ax2+bx+c=0, where user enter the value of a,b and c. </p>
 <p> 16) Find the largest among three different numbers entered by the user. </p>
 <p> 17) Write a program in C++ which is a Menu-Driven Program to compute the area of the various geometrical shape. E.g if user select choice 1 area of rectangle needed to be calculated for which take two inputs from user as length and width, for circle you have to take radius,  Shapes 1) rectangle 2) square 3)Circle 4) triangle
 </p>
 <p> 18) Write a program to show how many days a month have using switch statements take number of month from user . e.g 1 have 31 days means January  have 31 days. </p>
 <p> 19) A shop will give discount of 10% if the cost of purchased quantity is more than 1000.Ask user for quantity Suppose, one unit will cost 100. Judge and print total cost for user.
 </p>
 <p> 20) A company decided to give bonus of 5% to employee if his/her year of service is more than 5 years. Ask user for their salary and year of service and print the net bonus amount.
 </p>
 <p> 21) A student will not be allowed to sit in exam if his/her attendence is less than 75%.Take following input from user Number of classes held Number of classes attended. And print percentage of class attended Is student is allowed to sit in exam or not. Ask user for their salary and year of service and print the net bonus amount.
 </p>
 <p> 22) If
x = 2
y = 5
z = 0
then find values of the following expressions:
a. x == 2
b. x != 5
c. x != 5 && y >= 5
d. z != 0 || x == 2
e. !(y < 10)
 </p>
 <p> 23) Write a program to check if a year is leap year or not.
If a year is divisible by 4 then it is leap year but if the year is century year like 2000, 1900, 2100 then it must be divisible by 400.
 </p>
 <p> 24) A 4 digit number is entered through keyboard. Write a program to print a new number with digits reversed as of orignal one. E.g.-
INPUT : 1234        OUTPUT : 4321
INPUT : 5982        OUTPUT : 2895
